### Overview

WearNow is a German-based vintage clothing store specializing in curated collections from the 1950s to the 1990s. Their vision was to expand their local presence into the digital sphere, creating a website that reflected their unique aesthetic while serving as a comprehensive directory of physical stores where customers could purchase vintage clothing. As a freelance web developer, I had the privilege of developing their website to bring their vision to life.

### Goals

- Aesthetic Alignment: The website needed to mirror WearNow’s vintage ethos, featuring a design that feels nostalgic but modern enough to appeal to younger audiences.

- User-Friendly Experience: With a wide range of customers, the site had to be intuitive for both tech-savvy users and those less familiar with online navigation.

- Comprehensive Store Directory: A robust platform to showcase a large collection of physical vintage clothing stores with detailed information.

- Scalability: The site had to be easily updatable to accommodate new store listings and seasonal campaigns.

### The Development Process

#### Development

I chose CraftCMS as the content management system for its flexibility and scalability. Custom coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed for:

- Dynamic Store Filters: Visitors could search stores by decade, clothing type, or location.

- Interactive Map: An integrated map displaying the locations of all listed stores with clickable pins for more details.

- Localized Features: German and English language support to cater to both local and international visitors.

#### Testing & Launch

Before launch, I conducted extensive usability testing to ensure seamless navigation across devices. The site was optimized for speed and performance, ensuring quick loading times even with large store images and maps.

### Key Features Delivered

- Store Profiles: Each store had a dedicated page with detailed descriptions, photos, operating hours, and contact information.

- Interactive Map: A visually engaging map to help users locate stores easily.

- Integrated Blog: WearNow’s team could post articles about vintage fashion trends, store highlights, and shopping tips.

- Admin-Friendly Interface: A back-end system that allowed WearNow’s team to add or update store listings effortlessly.

### Results

Since its launch, the WearNow website has:

- Attracted significant traffic, with 70% of visitors engaging with the store directory.

- Increased foot traffic to listed stores by an average of 50%, as reported by participating retailers.

- Received positive feedback for its design and usability, with a 4.8/5 average customer satisfaction rating.

### Conclusion

Working on WearNow was a rewarding experience, blending creativity with technical expertise. The site not only achieved the client’s goals but also positioned WearNow as a central hub for vintage fashion enthusiasts. This project highlights the power of collaboration and thoughtful design in creating an impactful digital presence for unique brands.
